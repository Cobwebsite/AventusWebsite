<h1>Library - Animation</h1>

<p>The animation class allow you to execute a function at specific frames. The code is based on the <span class="cn"><a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame"
            target="_blank"></a>requestAnimationFrame</span>. One use case for the class can be the following : You have
    a to run some complex calculations when the user has the mouse press and moves the cursor on the screen. The event
    can be fired at anytime and can overload your website. To avoid that you can use the <span
        class="cn">Animation</span> like that.</p>
